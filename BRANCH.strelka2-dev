Goal of this branch is to implement --callRegions flag in strelka2 call.
This is described here: https://github.com/Illumina/strelka/blob/v2.9.x/docs/userGuide/README.md#extended-use-cases
Based on runs here: /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/TinDaisy/CromwellRunner/GBM.WGS.20191010
  strelka2 crashes repeatedly on WGS data, exits with error code 25

Also updating priority in merge step as discussed with Fernanda 11/8/19:
* SNV: varscan, mutect, strelka
* indel: varscan, pindel, strelka

Scripts here are designed to test individual steps of workflow inside of docker container
using MantaDemo dataset.  Like the StrelkaDemo dataset, MantaDemo is a small dataset 
which allows for the entire pipeline to be quickly exercised.  It was originally used with `manta_tool`, which 
did not discover any variants in the StrelkaDemo data

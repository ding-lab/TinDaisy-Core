Scripts to test VCF filters directly (from within docker container)

Testing here refers to validating that the code runs with no errors generated.
Output (stdout, stderr, and files generated)  must be examined by eye.  No
automated testing of results is performed.

Scripts generally rely on StrelkaDemo data, although the last several rely on data from
test run C3N-01649, which is not distributed with this project.  As a result these tests 
are not functional

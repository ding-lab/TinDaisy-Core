Scripts here are designed to test individual steps of workflow inside of docker container
using StrelkaDemo dataset.

Input data container paths are defined in `project_data.sh`.  Mapping of volumes occurs in `A_start_docker.sh`
These paths are based on those defined in `TinDaisy/testing/StrelkaDemo.dat/project_config.StrelkaDemo.yaml`

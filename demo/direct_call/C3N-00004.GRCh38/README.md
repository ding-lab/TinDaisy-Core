Scripts here are designed to test individual steps of workflow inside of docker container
using C3L-00004 dataset.

Input data container paths are defined in `project_data.sh`.  Mapping of volumes occurs in `A_start_docker.sh`
These paths are based on those defined in `TinDaisy/testing/YAML/katmai/C3L-00004.katmai.yaml"
